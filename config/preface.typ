= A Note on Learning

#v(0.5em)

Calculus is more than a set of rules for manipulating symbols; it is a way of thinking about the world. True mastery requires *active engagement* with the material. We encourage you to:

#v(0.3em)

- Attempt to solve the examples yourself before revealing the solution blocks.
- Focus on the geometric and physical intuition behind the formulas.
- Understand not just *how* to differentiate or integrate, but *when* and *why* these tools are used.
- Collaborate with peers to discuss concepts and refine your logical argumentation.

#v(0.5em)

The notes provided here are designed to support your learning journey, clarifying the lecture material and helping you build the confidence to solve real-world problems mathematically.


= Looking Ahead

#v(0.8em)

The concepts you master in *Calculus I*—limits, derivatives, and integrals—are the indispensable tools of the future. They are the language used to describe the motion of planets, the flow of fluids, the growth of populations, and the fluctuations of markets. Whether you pursue physics, engineering, economics, or computer science, the analytical framework you build here will serve as the foundation for your advanced studies.
